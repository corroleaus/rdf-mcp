This repository contains code for [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers supporting use of the Brick and 223P ontologies.

Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. 

This project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting. To format your code, run:

```bash
uv run --with dev black .
```

There are 2 MCP servers in this repository.

## Brick MCP Server

Loads latest 1.4 Brick ontology from [https://brickschema.org/schema/1.4/Brick.ttl](https://brickschema.org/schema/1.4/Brick.ttl)

It defines these tools:
- `expand_abbreviation`: uses the [Smash](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3685800.3685830) algorithm to attempt expanding common abbreviations (e.g. `AHU`) into Brick classes (e.g. `Air_Handling_Unit`)
- `get_terms`: returns a list of Brick classes
- `get_properties`: returns a list of Brick properties and object types
- `get_possible_properties`: returns a list of Brick properties and object types that can be used with a given Brick class
- `get_definition_brick`: returns the definition of a Brick class as the [CBD](https://www.w3.org/submissions/CBD/) of the Brick class

## 223P MCP Server

Loads latest 223P from [https://open223.info/223p.ttl](https://open223.info/223p.ttl)
- `get_terms`: returns a list of S223 classes
- `get_properties`: returns a list of S223 properties (not object types)
- `get_possible_properties`: returns a list of S223 properties and object types that can be used with a given S223 class
- `get_definition_223p`: returns the definition of a S223 class as the [CBD](https://www.w3.org/submissions/CBD/) of the S223 class

## Running the servers

### Claude Desktop

Should be as simple as `uv run mcp install brick.py`, then open Claude Desktop and look at the tools settings to ensure everything is working.

<details>
<summary>I had to make some edits for these to work on my own Claude Desktop installation. <b>Note:</b> You must set the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable to the root of this repository so that the servers can import the <code>rdf_mcp</code> package. Here is what my <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> file looks like (update the paths as needed for your system):</summary>
