Build a 223P model of this system. Look up definitions of concepts and their relationships to ensure you are building a valid 223P model. Use the more specific classes you can. Do not hallucinate predicates. Use the definitions of terms to determine what the required predicates are and make sure to add those to the graph. Use the tool to determine what properties a term can have. Only use the predicates defined by the ontology. Use the s223:cnx property for all connections; do not use connectedThrough, connectedFrom, connectedTo and other derived properties. Remember to add the s223:hasProperty edge to associate the observable and actuatable properties with the proper entities. Make sure to include an owl:Ontology declaration that imports the 223P ontology
